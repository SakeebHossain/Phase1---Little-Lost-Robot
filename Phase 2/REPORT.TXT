Please note below what parts of your task were completed, and for
incomplete tasks, give a brief description of progress and how
you think the task could be completed

a) The program can land the craft safely in mode '1'
  
   - for the 'easy.ppm' map (yes/no)
   - for the 'hard.ppm' map (yes/no)

   If it fails, describe the conditions in which it fails and how
   you think this could be resolved

b) The program can land the craft safely in mode '2'
  
   - for the 'easy.ppm' map (yes/no)
   - for the 'hard.ppm' map (yes/no)

   If it fails, describe the conditions in which it fails and how
   you think this could be resolved

Questions:

1) What was the impact of having noisy sensors in your ability to
   determine the state of the craft and ultimately control it 
   properly?

2) Describe the technique(s) you used to deal with sensor noise

3) Describe your strategy for dealing with thruster failures

4) Describe your strategy for dealing with sensor malfunctions:

   - Position sensors
   - Velocity sensors
   - Angle
   - Sonar

   What if you have multiple failures? what could you do if, for
   example both position and velocity sensors became inoperative?

5) What was the hardest failure type to deal with (i.e. which is
   the component, either sensor or control that makes the lander
   harder to handle?)?

6) Assume a human pilot was in charge of controlling the craft 
   (i.e. the pilot has control of thrusters and rotation).
   How would you change Safety_Override() so that it prevents
   the pilot from accidentally crashing the lander?
   
7) Do you think it is reasonable to write such a control function?
   (i.e. a routine that takes control from a human for their
    own safety)

8) Should the pilot be aware that this software is present?
   (yes or no, and tell me why you think so!)

9) Would you buy/drive a car that you know has control software
   that will take control from you if it estimates you are
   doing something dangerous?

10) Can you as an embedded systems designer think of every 
    possible scenario that could go wrong so as to write 
    control software that ALWAYS works?

    Think about that...
