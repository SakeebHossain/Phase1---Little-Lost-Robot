Questions:

0) What are the input(s) and output(s) of the system? what is the
   error signal you used to determine the force to be exerted by
   your controller?

1) What is the effect of m, m1, and l1 on the controllability of the
    system? what are the range of values for these variables that
    your controller can handle?
 
2) How does your controller work? explain to me the way this function
    decides how much force to apply. There should be a good reason for
    doing things, i.e. trial and error won't work well and won't result
    in a decent controller. Also, explain how you handled variations in
    the model's parameters.

3) What is the effect of the sampling period sp on the ability of your
    code to control the pendulum?
 
4) In an actual system, sp is typically a function of how long it takes
    for the control software to do the required computations and update
    all required variables. Given your answer to 3), do you think that
    a standard operationg system such as desktop Linux or Windows are
    suitable for running control software for critical systems?

5) You can easily balance an inverted umbrella, broom, or similar object
    on your hand. Do you think your brain builds a physical model of
    the system and then solves equations to accomplish this? if no,
    how do you think it manages to keep things balanced?
