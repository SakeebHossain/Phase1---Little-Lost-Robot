Please note below what parts of your task were completed, and for
incomplete tasks, give a brief description of progress and how
you think the task could be completed

a) Implemented randomized particle initialization: YES



b) Implemented particle likelihood computation using Gaussian 
   noise model.: YES


c) Implemented Step 1 in the starter code: YES



d) Implemented Step 3 in the starter code: YES



e) Implemented Step 4 in the starter code: YES

Questions:

1) For each of the maps provided, give your estimate of the minimum
   number of particles required for reliably successful localization
   (i.e. the robot succeeds almost always).

2) What properties of the map make the localization task difficult?


3) What is the effect of a non-Gaussian noise model in the performance
   of the particle filter?


4) What would you do to improve the sensor model?


5) The motion model is noisy. Each time the robot moves, the direction
   of motion is slightly altered in a random manner. This is why the
   robot wanders around instead of moving in a straight line.

   a) Is this something we can avoid in the real world?

  
   b) Is it a bug or a feature?

   
   c) Would the particle filter work with noiseless motion?
      if yes, under what conditions...
      if no, why?
